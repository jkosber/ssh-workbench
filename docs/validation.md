# Validation log

Evidence that automated checks cannot give: runs in a real terminal, checks
against real machines, and what a person saw. CI results, merges and tags live
on GitHub and are not copied here. Evidence for Tasks 1-18 is in
[the archive](archive/validation-tasks-1-18.md).

## How to add an entry

One section per task, newest first, written while the task is open:

```markdown
## Task N: short title, YYYY-MM-DD

Windows 11, Windows Terminal 80x24, Python 3.14.8, Textual 8.2.8.

| Check | Observed |
| --- | --- |
| What was run or done | What actually happened |

Not checked: what was left out, and why.
```

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Observed, not expected | Write what happened. A check that was planned but not run goes under "Not checked" |
| Real targets | Name only that Jadon approved the target; never its host name, alias, address or account |
| Screenshots | Only from fictional data; keep the rest in ignored `.local/` |
| Automated checks | One line with the test count is enough; CI keeps the rest |

## Task 19: documentation and workflow, 2026-10-22

Windows 11, Python 3.14.8, uv 0.13.4. Documentation only; no code changed.

| Check | Observed |
| --- | --- |
| Archive | `git diff -M` shows `docs/roadmap.md` and `docs/validation.md` moved unchanged to `docs/archive/` in one commit; the next adds only the PR #23 record, Task 18's two ticks, one backlog item, each file's header and relative links rewritten for the new folder |
